# Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
In this project, I have analyzed a dataset containing financial information. I have created various cards, tables, and charts to visualize the data. Card charts were used to display key metrics such as total sales and total profit. Additionally, I created stacked bar charts and pie charts to provide valuable insights from the data. To gain a deeper understanding of performance, I also included three table charts. A video is attached in this repository demonstrating how the pages navigate between each other by clicking on buttons.
